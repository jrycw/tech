This post demonstrates how to send emails using [Resend](https://resend.com/) from within a marimo app.

It seems the app runs fine locally but doesn't work in a WASM environment. Itâ€™ll be interesting to explore where the boundaries of WASM lie.

Check out the full marimo code below or view it on [molab](https://molab.marimo.io/notebooks/nb_9b9N9Lh1payY9HvowyzvSB).
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| code-summary: Show full code
{{< include mo_resend.py >}}
```
